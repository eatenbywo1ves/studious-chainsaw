- Categories (Technical, Problem-Solving, Data Analysis, Tools, Documentation)
- Date stamps
- Tags for easy searching
- Impact assessments

### üîß PowerShell Scripts

#### add_insight.ps1
Add new insights quickly from the command line:
```powershell
.\add_insight.ps1 -Title "Performance Optimization Discovery" `
                   -Category "Technical" `
                   -Description "Found that caching reduces API calls by 70%" `
                   -KeyPoints @("Use Redis for caching", "TTL of 5 minutes optimal") `
                   -Impact "Significant performance improvement" `
                   -Tags @("performance", "caching", "optimization")
```

#### view_insights.ps1
View and search insights:
```powershell
# View all insights

```

## Quick Usage

### Adding an Insight
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Corbin\Insights
.\add_insight.ps1 -Title "Your Title" -Category "Technical" -Description "What you learned"
```

### Viewing Insights
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Corbin\Insights
.\view_insights.ps1 -Recent
```

## Categories

- **üß† Technical**: Programming discoveries, best practices, technical solutions
- **üí° Problem-Solving**: Approaches and strategies that worked well
- **üìä Data & Analysis**: Patterns, trends, and important findings from data
- **üîß Tool & Workflow**: Useful tools, commands, and workflow improvements
- **üìù Documentation**: Effective ways to document and communicate ideas

## Found Existing Insights

During setup, we discovered you have several files with potential insights:
- `development\code_analysis_summary.md` - Code quality findings
- `development\critical_security_actions.md` - Security insights
- `WIRESHARK_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Network analysis insights
- `development\ssh_security_audit_report.md` - SSH security findings

Consider reviewing these files and extracting key insights to add to your tracker.

## Tips

1. **Be Consistent**: Add insights immediately after discovering them
2. **Use Tags**: Tags make it easy to find related insights later
3. **Include Impact**: Always note why an insight matters
4. **Review Regularly**: Use `.\view_insights.ps1 -Stats` to track your learning progress

## Automation Ideas

Consider adding these to your PowerShell profile for quick access:
```powershell
function Add-Insight {
    & "C:\Users\Corbin\Insights\add_insight.ps1" @args
}

function View-Insights {
    & "C:\Users\Corbin\Insights\view_insights.ps1" @args
}

Set-Alias -Name ai -Value Add-Insight
Set-Alias -Name vi -Value View-Insights
```

Then use: `ai -Title "..." -Category "..." -Description "..."`
