# Agent Configuration Analysis - Project Overrides Issue

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Issue:** Some agents showing as "overridden by projectSettings"
**Status:** Analysis Complete

---

## 🔍 Problem Summary

Based on the screenshot provided, several agents are being overridden by project-specific settings:
- **mcp-protocol-engineer** - ⚠️ Overridden by projectSettings
- **1invideo** - ⚠️ Overridden by projectSettings
- **sonnet** (possibly) - ⚠️ Overridden by projectSettings

These agents are defined globally in `.claude/agents/` but are being disabled or overridden for the current project.

## 🔍 Where Project Overrides Are Stored

Based on the investigation, project-specific agent overrides are NOT stored as visible files in the file system. Instead, they're likely stored in one of these locations:

### 1. Claude Code Internal Database
**Most Likely Location:**
- Stored in Claude Code's internal SQLite/IndexedDB database
- Not directly accessible via file system
- Managed through Claude Code UI settings

### 2. Possible Hidden Config Locations
**Checked but not found:**
```
✗ C:\Users\Corbin\development\.claude\
✗ C:\Users\Corbin\development\.claudeproject
✗ C:\Users\Corbin\development\project.json
✗ C:\Users\Corbin\.claude\projects\C--Users-Corbin-development\settings.json
```

**What was found:**
```
✓ C:\Users\Corbin\.claude\projects\C--Users-Corbin-development\
  └── bc7f29c6-21ec-445f-9b1c-e410f77a661a.jsonl (conversation history only)
```

## 🎯 Why Agents Are Being Overridden

### Possible Reasons:

**1. Project-Specific Agent Restrictions** ⭐ Most Likely
- Project has been configured to disable certain agents
- Configuration set through Claude Code UI
- Stored in internal database, not visible as file

**2. Agent Availability Configuration**
- Some agents may be restricted to specific project types
- `mcp-protocol-engineer` and `1invideo` might be considered external/optional
- Project settings might require explicit enablement

**3. Namespace/Naming Conflicts**
- Global agents might conflict with project-specific definitions
- Project settings take precedence over global settings

**4. Version/Compatibility Issues**
- Some agents might not be compatible with current project configuration
- Automatic override to prevent errors

## 🔧 How to Fix: Enable Overridden Agents

### Method 1: Claude Code UI Settings (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Open Project Settings
```
1. Open Claude Code
2. Navigate to project: C:\Users\Corbin\development
3. Access: Settings → Project Settings → Agents
```

**Step 2:** Check Agent Configuration
```
Look for:
- Agent override settings
- Disabled agents list
- Project-specific agent restrictions
```

**Step 3:** Enable Agents
```
- Find agents marked as "overridden by projectSettings"
- Toggle or enable them for this project
- Save changes
```

### Method 2: Reset Project Agent Settings

**If UI doesn't show agent settings:**
```bash
# 1. Check if there's a project database
cd C:\Users\Corbin\.claude\projects\C--Users-Corbin-development\
ls -la

# 2. Look for agent-related configuration
# (Currently only conversation history found)
```

### Method 3: Remove Project Override (Nuclear Option)

**⚠️ WARNING: This will reset ALL project-specific settings**
```bash
# Backup first
cd C:\Users\Corbin\.claude\projects\
cp -r C--Users-Corbin-development C--Users-Corbin-development-backup

# Remove project settings (conversation history will be lost)
rm -rf C--Users-Corbin-development

# Restart Claude Code - it will recreate with default settings
```

### Method 4: Explicit Agent Configuration File

**Create project-specific agent config (if supported):**
```bash
# Create .claude directory in project
cd C:\Users\Corbin\development
mkdir .claude

# Create agents.json (format may vary by Claude Code version)
cat > .claude/agents.json <<EOF
{
  "enabledAgents": [
    "mcp-protocol-engineer",
    "mcp-expert",
    "1invideo",
    "architect",
    "developer",
    "qa",
    "scrum-master",
    "product-manager",
    "system-cleanup-analyzer",
    "multi-agent-observatory"
  ],
  "disabledAgents": []
}
EOF
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Agent Override Architecture:**
1. **Global Definition**: All agents defined in `~/.claude/agents/*.md`
2. **Project Overrides**: Stored in Claude Code internal database (not file system)
3. **Precedence**: Project settings > Global settings
4. **UI Required**: Must use Claude Code UI to modify project-specific agent settings

## 📋 Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order):

**1. Check Claude Code UI Settings** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```
Open Claude Code → Settings → Project Settings → Agents
Look for disabled/overridden agents
Enable mcp-protocol-engineer and 1invideo if needed
```

**2. Verify Agent Functionality**
```bash
# Test if agents are actually unavailable
# Try invoking them from Claude Code
```

**3. Document Current Configuration**
```bash
# Take screenshot of Claude Code agent settings
# Document which agents are enabled/disabled
# Note any project-specific requirements
```

**4. Consider Agent Necessity**
```
Ask: Do we actually need these agents for this project?
- mcp-protocol-engineer: Useful for MCP server work
- 1invideo: Useful for video creation tasks
- If not needed, keep them disabled
```

### Optional Actions:

**5. Create Project Documentation**
```markdown
# Create: .claude/README.md in project
Document:
- Which agents are enabled
- Why certain agents are disabled
- Project-specific agent requirements
```

**6. Review Agent Usage Patterns**
```
Analyze:
- Which agents are actually being used
- Which agents could be removed globally
- Whether new project-specific agents are needed
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Don't Delete Global Agent Files
- Even if overridden, agents are still defined globally
- Other projects might use them
- Override is project-specific, not global

### ⚠️ Project Settings Precedence
- Project settings ALWAYS override global settings
- This is intentional design for project-specific workflows
- Cannot be changed without modifying project configuration

### ⚠️ Agent Availability vs. Agent Override
- **Available**: Agent file exists, can be used
- **Overridden**: Project settings disable/restrict agent
- **Unavailable**: Agent file doesn't exist or is broken

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Open Claude Code UI** and navigate to project settings
2. **Locate agent configuration** section
3. **Review overridden agents** and their status
4. **Enable needed agents** (mcp-protocol-engineer, 1invideo)
5. **Test agent functionality** after changes
6. **Document configuration** for future reference

## 📊 Summary

### Problem
- 3 agents showing as "overridden by projectSettings"
- Agent files exist and are properly configured
- Project-specific settings are disabling them

### Root Cause
- Project-level agent configuration stored in Claude Code internal database
- Not visible as file in file system
- Requires UI access to modify

### Solution
- Use Claude Code UI to access project settings
- Navigate to agent configuration
- Enable overridden agents as needed
- Alternative: Create `.claude/agents.json` in project (if supported)

### Impact
- No data loss or configuration corruption
- Agents can be re-enabled through UI
- Other agents remain functional
- Project-specific override is working as designed
