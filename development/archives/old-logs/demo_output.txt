   A=B |- f(A)=f(B) (Substitute equals for equals)

4. INEQUALITY
   A<=B, B<=C |- A<=C (Inequality transitivity)

5. MONOTONICITY
   A<=B |- f(A)<=f(B) for monotone f

6. ASSUMPTION

Example: Proof using multiple inference rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem: Example_Multi_Rule_Proof
Statement: Batching N operations reduces overhead by factor of N
Method: direct

Assumptions:
  1. Fixed overhead O per operation
  2. N operations with identical overhead
  3. Batching combines overheads

Proof Steps:
  1. Individual operations: N × O total overhead
     [arithmetic] Each of N operations incurs overhead O
  2. Batched operations: 1 × O total overhead
     [definition] Single batched operation with single overhead
  3. Overhead reduction = (N×O) / (1×O) = N
     [arithmetic] Ratio of original to batched overhead (refs: 1, 2)

Conclusion: Batching achieves N-fold overhead reduction

Confidence: 0.00%
