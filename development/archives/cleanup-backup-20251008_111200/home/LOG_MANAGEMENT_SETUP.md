  - Cleans multiple directories automatically
  - Reports space freed and files removed

### 2. Scheduled Task
- **Task Name**: WeeklyLogCleanup
- **Schedule**: Every Sunday at 2:00 AM
- **Status**: Active and tested successfully
- **Last Run**: Successfully executed (Result Code: 0)
- **Next Run**: Sunday, September 21, 2025 at 2:00 AM

### 3. Management Scripts

- **schedule_log_cleanup.ps1**: PowerShell version with advanced options
- **check_cleanup_status.bat**: Check task status anytime

## Directories Being Cleaned
1. `.gradle/daemon` - Gradle build daemon logs
2. `.claude/mcp-server-analytic/logs` - MCP server logs
3. `AppData/Local/AnthropicClaude` - Claude application logs
4. `projects/agents/multi-agent-observatory/logs` - Agent logs
5. `development/logs` - Development logs

## Manual Operations

### Run Cleanup Immediately
```bash
python cleanup_logs.py
```

### Check Task Status
```powershell
schtasks /query /tn "WeeklyLogCleanup" /fo LIST /v
```

### Run Scheduled Task Manually
```powershell
schtasks /run /tn "WeeklyLogCleanup"
```

### Disable Task Temporarily
```powershell
schtasks /change /tn "WeeklyLogCleanup" /disable
```

### Re-enable Task
```powershell
schtasks /change /tn "WeeklyLogCleanup" /enable
```

### Delete Task
```powershell
schtasks /delete /tn "WeeklyLogCleanup" /f
```

## Customization

To modify cleanup settings, edit `cleanup_logs.py`:
- `max_age_days=7`: Change to keep logs for more/fewer days
- `max_size_mb=10`: Change to adjust size threshold

## Troubleshooting

### If the task doesn't run:
1. Ensure Python path is correct: `C:\Python313\python.exe`
2. Check Windows Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System
3. Run `check_cleanup_status.bat` to verify task configuration

### If cleanup fails:
1. Check file permissions in target directories
2. Ensure no applications are actively writing to logs
3. Review Python error output in Task Scheduler history

## Success Metrics
- **Initial Cleanup**: 5 files removed, 0.16 MB freed
- **Gradle Logs**: Reduced from 11 to 3 files
- **Large Files**: Removed 2 files totaling 76MB

## Notes
- The task runs with your user credentials
- Logs are cleaned conservatively (7 days retention)
- The system will continue running even if some directories don't exist
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
