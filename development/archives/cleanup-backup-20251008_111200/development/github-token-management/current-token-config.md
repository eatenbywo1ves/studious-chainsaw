## Token Usage Capabilities

### What You Can Do With Current Token:
1. **Repository Management**
   - Create, update, delete repositories
   - Manage repository settings and webhooks
   - Full access to all repository content

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Create and manage issues
   - Create and merge pull requests
   - Manage repository collaborators

3. **Gist Operations**
   - Create public and secret gists
   - Update and delete existing gists
   - Star and fork gists

4. **Organization Access**
   - Read organization membership
   - View team memberships
   - Access organization repositories (read-only)

### Current Limitations:
- Cannot manage GitHub Apps or installations
- No access to GitHub Packages
- Cannot manage organization settings
- No workflow or GitHub Actions permissions
- Cannot access security advisories or vulnerability alerts

## Security Assessment

### Strengths:
- Token stored securely in Windows Credential Manager
- Using HTTPS protocol for all Git operations
- Token has appropriate scopes for development work
- Not exposing token in environment variables

### Recommendations:
1. Consider creating separate tokens for different use cases
2. Set up token expiration (currently no expiration set)
3. Enable SSO if part of an organization
4. Regular token rotation (every 30-90 days)
5. Use fine-grained PATs for specific repositories

## Quick Reference Commands

### Check Token Status
```bash
gh auth status
```

### Test Token Permissions
```bash
gh api user
gh api rate_limit
```

### List Accessible Repos
```bash
gh repo list --limit 10
```

### Refresh Token
```bash
gh auth refresh
```

## Next Steps
1. Create specialized tokens for different purposes
2. Set up automated token rotation
3. Implement environment-specific configurations
4. Create backup authentication methods
