# GPU Acceleration Setup Status

## Current Configuration

### Hardware
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080
- **Memory**: 8GB GDDR5X
- **Compute Capability**: 6.1
- **Driver Version**: 566.36
- **CUDA Version (Driver)**: 12.7

### Software Installed
- **CUDA Toolkit**: 13.0 (C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.0)
- **NVCC Compiler**: 13.0.88
- **Python**: 3.13
- **NumPy**: Installed
- **Numba**: 0.62.0 (Can detect GPU but CUDA not available for kernels)
- **CuPy**: cupy-cuda12x 13.6.0 (DLL mismatch with CUDA 13.0)
- **PyTorch**: 2.8.0+cpu (CPU-only version)

## Issues Identified

### 1. CuPy Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: CuPy is looking for CUDA 12.x libraries (nvrtc64_120_0.dll)
- **Installed**: CUDA 13.0 libraries
- **Solution**: Need to either:
  - Downgrade CUDA to 12.x
  - Install CuPy for CUDA 13.0 (may not exist yet)
  - Use alternative GPU libraries

### 2. ✅ PyTorch with CUDA - RESOLVED
- **Problem**: PyTorch was CPU-only, Python 3.13 incompatible
- **Solution**: Installed Python 3.12 and PyTorch with CUDA 12.1
- **Status**: WORKING - Achieving up to 20.54x speedup on 3D lattices
- **Benchmark**: See pytorch_benchmark_results.md

### 3. Numba CUDA Detection
- **Problem**: Numba detects the GPU but reports CUDA as unavailable
- **Possible causes**:
  - Python 3.13 compatibility issues
  - CUDA 13.0 not yet supported by Numba
  - Missing CUDA runtime libraries

## Working Components

✅ **NVIDIA Driver**: Properly installed and functioning
✅ **nvidia-smi**: Shows GPU status correctly
✅ **CUDA Toolkit**: Installed and nvcc compiler works
✅ **GPU Detection**: All libraries can see the GTX 1080
✅ **PyTorch CUDA**: Full GPU acceleration working (2.5.1+cu121)
✅ **Python 3.12**: Installed for PyTorch compatibility

## Non-Working Components

❌ **CuPy**: DLL version mismatch
❌ **PyTorch CUDA**: CPU-only version installed
❌ **Numba CUDA Kernels**: CUDA reported as unavailable

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Downgrade to CUDA 12.x (Recommended)
1. Uninstall CUDA 13.0
2. Install CUDA 12.1 or 12.2
3. Reinstall CuPy: `pip install cupy-cuda12x`
4. Install PyTorch with CUDA: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

### Option 2: Use CPU Optimization Only
1. Continue with NumPy/Numba CPU parallelization
2. Achieved speedups are already significant (649x)
3. GPU would provide additional 10-50x on top

### Option 3: Docker with CUDA
1. Use NVIDIA Docker runtime
2. Pull a CUDA 12.x container
3. Run GPU workloads in container

## Performance Without GPU

Current achievements without GPU acceleration:
- **Memory Reduction**: 28,571x ✅
- **CPU Parallel Processing**: 649x speedup ✅
- **Test Coverage**: 97.4% ✅

The system is **fully functional** without GPU acceleration. GPU would provide additional performance benefits but is not required for production deployment.

## Fallback Strategy

Since the catalytic computing system already exceeds performance targets without GPU:

1. **Use CPU parallelization** (already implemented and tested)
2. **Document GPU setup** for future enhancement
3. **Deploy production system** with CPU optimization
4. **Add GPU support** in Phase 2 when CUDA dependencies are resolved

## Conclusion

The GPU acceleration setup is partially complete:
- Hardware and drivers are properly installed
- Software dependencies have version conflicts
- System runs successfully with CPU parallelization

**Recommendation**: Proceed with production deployment using CPU parallelization. GPU acceleration can be added later as an enhancement when dependency issues are resolved.
