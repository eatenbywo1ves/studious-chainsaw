## Monitor Progress

### Option 1: Check Installation Log
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd ~/nvidia-toolkit-research
tail -f logs/*.log
```

### Option 2: View Checkpoints Completed
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
ls -1 ~/nvidia-toolkit-research/checkpoints/*.done
```

### Option 3: Generate Progress Dashboard
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd /mnt/c/Users/Corbin/development/security/wiz-challenge
./generate-dashboard.sh
```

## What To Do While Waiting

### 1. Review Documentation
- Read `EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK.md` for Week 1 details
- Review `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for next steps
- Study the 7-week systematic plan

### 2. Review Research Reports
- `NVIDIA_Container_Toolkit_Security_Research_Report.md` (60+ pages)
- `CONTAINER_ESCAPE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` (300+ pages)

### 3. Prepare for Next Steps
- Understand detection rules in `falco-nvidia-rules.yaml`
- Review test suite in `test-suite.sh`
- Plan Week 1 Day 2 activities

## Expected Completion

When the installation completes (in ~10-15 minutes), you will see:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                Installation Complete!                         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Completion Status: 14/14 checkpoints (100%)
✓ All checkpoints passed!

Next steps:
1. Deploy Falco detection rules
2. Run Docker Bench Security audit
3. Test detection capabilities
4. Review baseline configuration

Research directory: /home/orbin/nvidia-toolkit-research
```

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Check the Logs
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd ~/nvidia-toolkit-research/logs
cat *.log
```

### Check Which Checkpoint Failed
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd ~/nvidia-toolkit-research/checkpoints
ls -1 *.done
# Count completed: should have 14 when done
```

### Manual Installation
If automated installation fails, follow `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` step-by-step.
