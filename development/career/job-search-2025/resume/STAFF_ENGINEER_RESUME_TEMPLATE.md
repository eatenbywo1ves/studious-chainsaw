  - Token revocation via JTI blacklist (production: Redis integration)
  - API key hashing (never store plaintext) with prefix display for UX
  - Automated security audits and penetration testing in deployment pipeline
  - Result: Zero security incidents in production, SOC 2 compliance ready

**Infrastructure & Observability:**
- 📈 **Built comprehensive observability platform** reducing MTTR from 45min to 8min:
  - Prometheus metrics implementing Four Golden Signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
  - Real-time Grafana dashboards with WebSocket push updates (92% bandwidth savings vs polling)
  - Circuit breaker patterns: /health (liveness) vs /ready (readiness) probes
