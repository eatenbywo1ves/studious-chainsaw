# GhidraGo Phase 2 - Environment Assessment Report

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**System**: Windows 10/11
**Assessment Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Environment Check Results

### Go Compiler Status
- **Status**: ❌ Not Installed
- **Checked Locations**:
  - `C:\Go\bin\go.exe` - NOT FOUND
  - `C:\Program Files\Go\bin\go.exe` - NOT FOUND
  - System PATH - NOT FOUND

### Decision: Use Pre-built Go Binaries
Since the Go compiler is not installed, we will proceed with **Path B** from the deployment plan:
- Download existing Go binaries (Hugo, Docker CLI, or Kubectl)
- Test GhidraGo Phase 2 on production Go code
- Skip compilation of custom test binaries (for now)

---

## Recommended Test Binaries

### Option 1: Hugo (Static Site Generator) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Why Hugo?**
- Written entirely in Go
- Rich type information (structs, interfaces, embedded fields)
- Moderate size (~20MB executable)
- Actively maintained
- Well-structured codebase

**Download**:
- URL: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest
- File: `hugo_extended_X.X.X_windows-amd64.zip`
- Extract: `hugo.exe` (~20-30MB)

**Expected GhidraGo Results**:
- 100-200+ struct types
- Complex nested structures
- Interface types with methods
- Real-world Go patterns

---

### Option 2: Docker CLI
**Why Docker?**
- Large, complex Go application
- Extensive use of interfaces
- ~60MB executable
- Industry-standard tool

**Download**:
- URL: https://download.docker.com/win/static/stable/x86_64/
- File: `docker-XX.XX.X.zip`
- Extract: `docker.exe`

**Expected GhidraGo Results**:
- 500+ struct types
- Extensive interface usage
- Complex type hierarchies
- May take longer to analyze (~1-2 minutes)

---

### Option 3: Kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
**Why Kubectl?**
- Medium-sized Go binary
- Cloud-native patterns
- ~50MB executable

**Download**:
- URL: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
- Direct download of `kubectl.exe`

**Expected GhidraGo Results**:
- 200-300+ struct types
- API client patterns
- REST/HTTP structures

---

## Testing Strategy Without Custom Test Binaries

### Phase 1: Quick Validation (Hugo)
1. Download Hugo (~5 minutes)
2. Import to Ghidra (~5 minutes)
3. Run GhidraGo Phase 2 (~30 seconds)
4. Verify basic functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Script completes without errors
- Types extracted (any number > 0)
- Struct fields visible with names
- No infinite loops or crashes

---

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Validation (Optional - Docker/Kubectl)
1. Download additional binary
2. Import to Ghidra
3. Run GhidraGo Phase 2
4. Compare results with Hugo

**Success Criteria**:
- Consistent behavior across binaries
- Large number of types extracted
- Performance acceptable (< 2 minutes)

---

## Alternative: Install Go Compiler (Future)

If custom test binaries are needed later:

### Installation Steps
1. **Download Go**:
   - Visit: https://go.dev/dl/
   - Download: `go1.25.X.windows-amd64.msi`

2. **Install**:
   - Run MSI installer
   - Accept defaults (C:\Go)

3. **Verify**:
   ```batch
   go version
   ```

4. **Compile Test Binaries**:
   ```batch
   cd C:\Users\Corbin\development\GhidraGo\test_binaries
   build_tests.bat
   ```

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

---

## Current Plan: Proceed with Pre-built Binaries

### Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ **Download Hugo** (use `download_prebuilt_go_binary.bat`)
   - Execute helper script
   - Or manual download from GitHub
   - Place in `prebuilt_binaries/` directory

2. **Create Ghidra Test Project**
   - Launch Ghidra
   - Create new project: "GhidraGo_Phase2_Validation"
   - Import hugo.exe

3. **Run GhidraGo Phase 2**
   - Execute RecoverGoFunctionsAndTypes.py
   - Monitor console output
   - Verify Data Type Manager

4. **Document Results**
   - Create validation report
   - Screenshot successful extractions
   - Note any issues

---

## Advantages of Pre-built Binary Approach

✅ **No installation required** - Start testing immediately
✅ **Real-world validation** - Test on production Go code
✅ **Comprehensive testing** - Hugo has 100+ types vs 5-10 in custom tests
✅ **Time efficient** - Skip compilation step (~15 minutes saved)
✅ **Representative** - Real Go patterns vs simplified test cases

---

## Disadvantages

❌ **Less controlled** - Can't test specific edge cases
❌ **Unknown ground truth** - Don't know exact expected output
❌ **Larger binaries** - Analysis may take longer
❌ **Complex debugging** - Harder to isolate issues

---

## Mitigation Strategy

**If issues found with pre-built binaries**:
1. Document the issue
2. Consider installing Go compiler
3. Create minimal test case reproducing issue
4. Fix and re-test

**For now**: Pre-built binaries are sufficient for initial validation

---

## System Capabilities

**Available Tools**:
- ✅ Ghidra (assumed installed based on project structure)
- ✅ Python (Ghidra scripting)
- ✅ Web browser (for downloads)
- ❌ Go compiler (not installed)
- ❌ Docker (not in PATH)

**System Resources**:
- OS: Windows (Git Bash available)
- Storage: Sufficient for test binaries
- Network: Available for downloads

---

## Conclusion

**Environment Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing (Path B)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Hugo as primary test binary
- Download: 5 minutes
- Import: 5 minutes
- Test: 5 minutes
- **Total time to first validation**: ~15 minutes

**Next Step**: Execute `download_prebuilt_go_binary.bat` or manually download Hugo

---
