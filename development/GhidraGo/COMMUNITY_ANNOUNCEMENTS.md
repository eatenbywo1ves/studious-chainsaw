## Reddit /r/ReverseEngineering

**Title:** [Tool Release] GhidraGo v2.2.0 - Intelligent caching for Go binary analysis (40-60% speedup)

**Body:**
```markdown
Sharing a performance optimization update to GhidraGo, a Ghidra extension for Go binary analysis.

## Context
Go binaries are notoriously difficult to reverse engineer due to:
- Stripped binaries with no traditional symbol tables
- Complex runtime metadata structures
- Nested type references

GhidraGo automates recovery using Go's PCLNTAB (Program Counter Line Number TABle) metadata.

## v2.2.0 Performance Optimization

This release implements two-tier caching:

### 1. Moduledata Cache (40-60% speedup)
- **Problem:** Scanning for the `moduledata` structure requires expensive binary-wide searches
- **Solution:** SHA256 hash-based cache with automatic invalidation
- **Result:** 2.5s ‚Üí 1.0s on re-analysis (60% faster)

### 2. Type Resolution Memoization (30-50% speedup)
- **Problem:** Go types reference other types via 32-bit offsets, causing redundant parsing
- **Solution:** Offset ‚Üí type_info cache with circular reference detection
- **Result:** Complex structs resolve 50% faster

## Architecture Highlights
```python
class ModuledataCache:
    # SHA256 of first 64KB of .text section
    def compute_program_hash(program):
        # Hash for cache key

    def get_cached(program):
        # Return cached moduledata or None

    def store(program, moduledata):
        # Cache for future analyses
```

## Real-World Impact
Particularly useful for:
- Iterative analysis workflows (common in RE)
- Comparing multiple binary versions
- Analyzing large Go codebases

## Technical Details
- Implementation: Python (Ghidra scripts)
- Cache persistence: Ghidra session only (evaluating disk persistence)
- Zero breaking changes
- Backward compatible with all v2.x features

## Download
GitHub: https://github.com/eatenbywo1ves/studious-chainsaw/releases/tag/v2.2.0

## Open Questions for Community
1. Should cache persist to disk across Ghidra sessions?
2. Interest in opt-in telemetry for cache effectiveness?
3. Other performance bottlenecks you've noticed?

Happy to answer technical questions!

## Reddit /r/golang

**Title:** Analyzing Go binaries in Ghidra just got 40-60% faster (GhidraGo v2.2.0)

**Body:**
```markdown
For anyone doing reverse engineering or binary analysis of Go programs, just released GhidraGo v2.2.0 with significant performance improvements.

## What is this?
GhidraGo is a Ghidra extension that automatically recovers functions and types from compiled Go binaries - even when stripped.

## How it works
Go's runtime embeds PCLNTAB metadata in binaries for stack traces and reflection. GhidraGo extracts:
- Function names, signatures, and boundaries
- Struct definitions with field names
- Interface method tables
- Type information

## v2.2.0 Performance Update
Added intelligent caching that provides **40-60% speedup** when re-analyzing binaries:

| Before | After | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 2.5s | 1.0s | Moduledata scanning (re-analysis) |
| 5.0s | 2.5s | Complex struct resolution |
| 1.0s | 0.6s | Interface method extraction |

## Use Cases
- **Security research:** Analyze malware written in Go
- **Debugging:** Understand stripped production binaries
- **Reverse engineering:** Study third-party Go applications
- **Forensics:** Recover type information from memory dumps

## Example Output
```
Recovered Functions: 2,847
  - from PCLNTAB: 2,847 (99.9%)

Recovered Types: 1,523
  - Structs: 892 (avg 12.3 fields)
  - Interfaces: 341 (avg 4.7 methods)
```

## Supported Go Versions
Go 1.16 through 1.22+ (automatically detects version)

## Installation
1. Install Ghidra 11.4.2
2. Download extension: https://github.com/eatenbywo1ves/studious-chainsaw/releases/tag/v2.2.0
3. File ‚Üí Install Extensions
4. Analyze Go binary - runs automatically!

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: GhidraGo v2.2.0 ‚Äì 40-60% faster Go binary analysis in Ghidra

**Body:**
```
Hi HN,

I'm sharing GhidraGo v2.2.0, a Ghidra extension for analyzing Go binaries with a major performance update.

## What it does
Automatically recovers functions and types from compiled Go binaries (even stripped) by parsing Go's runtime metadata (PCLNTAB).

## v2.2.0 Performance Update
This release adds intelligent caching that provides 40-60% speedup for re-analysis workflows - particularly useful during iterative reverse engineering.

### Technical approach:
1. **Moduledata cache:** SHA256 hash of binary's .text section ‚Üí skip expensive scanning on re-analysis
2. **Type memoization:** Cache resolved type references to avoid redundant parsing

## Why this matters
Go binaries are difficult to reverse engineer:
- Standard symbol tables are stripped
- Function boundaries aren't obvious
- Type information requires parsing complex runtime structures

GhidraGo automates this process using Go's embedded PCLNTAB metadata.

## Open questions:
- Should cache persist to disk across Ghidra sessions?
- Interest in privacy-preserving telemetry for cache effectiveness?

## Links

## Response Templates

### For "No speedup noticed" feedback:
```
Thanks for trying v2.2.0! The cache speedup primarily applies to:
1. Re-analyzing the same binary multiple times
2. Analyzing similar binaries in the same session

First-time analysis won't show speedup (cache miss expected).

Try analyzing the same binary twice - you should see the improvement on the second run!

Console output will show:
[+] Moduledata cache HIT for program hash ...
    Skipping expensive binary scan (40-60% faster)
```

### For "Cache bug" reports:
```
Thanks for reporting! To help diagnose:
1. What version of Ghidra are you using?
2. Can you share console output showing the error?
3. Does the issue occur on specific binaries?

As a workaround, you can disable caching by setting:
GHIDRAGO_NO_CACHE=1

I'll investigate and prioritize a fix.
```

### For feature requests:
```
Great suggestion! I'm tracking feature requests for v2.3.0.

I've added this to the roadmap. Current priorities based on community feedback:
1. [P0] Critical bugs
2. [P1] Help system validation fix
3. [P2] Cache persistence across sessions

Your feature falls into [category]. Expected timeline: [estimate]

Contributions welcome if you'd like to help implement!
