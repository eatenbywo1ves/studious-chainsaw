# üöÄ START DEPLOYMENT - Execute Now
**Time Required:** 20-25 minutes
**Platforms:** Docker Hub + Railway.app + Render.com
**Prerequisites:** Docker Hub account (free at https://hub.docker.com)

---

## Step 1: Docker Hub Login (2 minutes)

### Option A: Interactive Login
```bash
docker login
# Enter your Docker Hub username
# Enter your Docker Hub password or access token
```

### Option B: Environment Variable Login (if you have credentials)
```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-password-or-token
echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

**Verify Login:**
```bash
docker info | grep Username
# Should show: Username: your-username
```

---

## Step 2: Push Image to Docker Hub (5 minutes)

### Automated Script Method (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:/Users/Corbin/go-deployment-demo

# Set your Docker Hub username
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username

# Run the deployment script
bash deploy-to-dockerhub.sh
```

### Manual Method (Alternative)
```bash
cd C:/Users/Corbin/go-deployment-demo

# Replace 'your-username' with your actual Docker Hub username
export DOCKER_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username

# Tag the image
docker tag go-deployment-demo:1.0.0 $DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo:1.0.0
docker tag go-deployment-demo:1.0.0 $DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo:latest

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo:1.0.0
docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo:latest
```

**Verify Push:**
```bash
# Check on Docker Hub
echo "Visit: https://hub.docker.com/r/$DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo/tags"

# Or pull to verify
docker pull $DOCKER_USERNAME/go-deployment-demo:latest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Hub Push Fails

**Problem:** "denied: requested access to the resource is denied"
```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're logged in
docker login
# Verify username matches
docker info | grep Username
```

**Problem:** "unauthorized: authentication required"
```bash
# Solution: Re-login with correct credentials
docker logout
docker login
```

### Railway Deployment Fails

**Problem:** "Failed to pull image"
- Check image name is correct (case-sensitive)
- Verify image is public on Docker Hub
- Try using full image URL: `docker.io/username/repo:tag`

**Problem:** "Application failed to respond"
- Verify PORT environment variable is set to 8080
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Ensure health check path is `/health`

### Render Deployment Fails

**Problem:** "Image pull failed"
- Ensure using full image URL: `docker.io/username/repo:latest`
- Verify image is public (not private)
- Check image exists on Docker Hub

**Problem:** "Health check failing"
- Verify Health Check Path is `/health`
- Ensure port is set to 8080
- Check service logs for errors

## ‚úÖ Recent Fixes Applied (2025-10-06)

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Health Check Fixed** - Switched from `scratch` to `alpine:3.18` base image to support wget-based health checks
2. **Port Conflict Resolved** - Changed local swarm port from 8081 to 8082 (redis-commander uses 8081)
3. **Replica Count Fixed** - Reduced from 3 to 2 replicas to match placement constraints
4. **Container Stability** - All containers now start successfully and pass health checks

### Changes Made:
- **Dockerfile**: Now uses `alpine:3.18` instead of `scratch` for health check support (~7MB image)
- **docker-compose.prod.yml**: Port changed to 8082, replicas set to 2
- **Image Status**: Rebuilt and tested - all endpoints responding correctly
