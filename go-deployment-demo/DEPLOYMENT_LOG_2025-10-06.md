# Docker Deployment - Work Log & Closeout
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 10:15 AM CDT
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully diagnosed and resolved all Docker deployment issues, rebuilt the image with proper health checks, deployed to Docker Swarm, and published to Docker Hub. The application is now ready for cloud deployment to Railway and Render.

---

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Health Check Failure (CRITICAL)
**Problem:**
- Docker containers failing with exit code 2: "unhealthy container"
- Health check command failing in Dockerfile
- Docker Swarm service continuously restarting (10+ failed attempts)

**Root Cause:**
- Base image was `scratch` (minimal, no utilities)
- Health check used `CMD ["/go-deployment-demo", "health"]` which didn't exist
- No wget/curl available for HTTP health checks

**Fix Applied:**
```dockerfile
# Before:
FROM scratch
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD ["/go-deployment-demo", "health"] || exit 1

# After:
FROM alpine:3.18
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates wget
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ All containers passing health checks

---

### 2. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Port Conflict (8081)
**Problem:**
- docker-compose.prod.yml configured to use port 8081
- Port 8081 already in use by redis-commander
- Service couldn't bind to port

**Fix Applied:**
```yaml
# Before:
ports:
  - "8081:8080"

# After:
ports:
  - "8082:8080"
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ No port conflicts, service accessible on 8082

---

### 3. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Replica Placement Constraint Violation
**Problem:**
- Configured 3 replicas with `max_replicas_per_node: 2`
- Single node cannot host 3 replicas with this constraint
- Error: "no suitable node (max replicas per node limit exceed)"

**Fix Applied:**
```yaml
# Before:
replicas: 3

# After:
replicas: 2
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Both replicas running successfully

---

### 4. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ User Permission Issue (Build Error)
**Problem:**
- Build failed: "addgroup: gid '65534' in use"
- Attempted to create user/group that already exists in Alpine

**Fix Applied:**
```dockerfile
# Before:
RUN addgroup -g 65534 -S appgroup && adduser -u 65534 -S appuser -G appgroup
USER appuser:appgroup

# After:
USER nobody:nobody
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Build succeeds, runs as non-root user

---

## Performance Metrics

### Build Performance
- Build Time: ~40 seconds
- Test Time: ~8 seconds
- Total Build: ~48 seconds

### Deployment Performance
- Swarm Deploy: <5 seconds
- Container Start: <10 seconds
- Health Check: <5 seconds
- Total Ready: <20 seconds

### Image Efficiency
- Original (scratch): 10.3MB
- Current (alpine): 27.8MB
- Increase: +17.5MB (acceptable for stability)
- Layers: 6 layers

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Health Checks Matter:** Scratch images are minimal but lack basic utilities needed for health checks
2. **Port Management:** Always verify ports before deployment to avoid conflicts
3. **Replica Constraints:** Match replica count to placement constraints
4. **Trade-offs:** Slightly larger image (27.8MB vs 10.3MB) is worth it for reliable health checks

---
